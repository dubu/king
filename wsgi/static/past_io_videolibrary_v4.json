Google's definition of research is broad and happens in multiple ways across the organization.  Our research results in technology advances in the areas of Audio/Video Fingerprinting, Image Understanding, MapReduce/Parallel Computing, Deep Learning, and Parsing at Scale, which we apply to many of our products.  And, it also results in new whole new products, such as Voice Search and Google Translate.

However, there's still a lot of confusion over what MVP actually is and the best way to implement it. Many common solutions involve tedious amounts of boilerplate and overhead. In this talk, I will demonstrate that using MVP and the EventBus correctly is easier than you probably think it is and can be done without any frameworks or extra overhead.
